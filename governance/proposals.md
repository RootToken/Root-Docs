### RIP <a href="#rip" id="rip"></a>

Root Improvement Proposals, or RIPs, are proposals to change the Root protocol. Any account that owns Roots can participate in Root governance. Any account can become a Root Holder and participate in Root governance by Minting Roots for Beanstalk Silo Deposits on the Minting Whitelist through Root at any time. Any account that owns more than 0.1% of total outstanding Roots can submit a RIP to the [Root DAO Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/rootsmoney.eth) via the Root DAO Multisig (RDM). A Root holder’s voting power is proportional to their Root balance relative to the total Root supply.

Root DAO only accepts votes in favor of RIPs. An account’s vote for a given RIP is counted as the minimum of its Roots between the beginning and end of the Voting Period.

Voting for RIPs will take place on Snapshot, using Root ownership at the time of proposal on Snapshot. The Voting Period opens when a vote for a RIP can be submitted to Snapshot and ends at approximately the beginning of the 168th Beanstalk Season after it begins, or when the RIP is committed with a supermajority. Any Root holder can vote for or against any Snapshot proposal. In all instances, 1 Root equals 1 vote, and voting against a proposal is equivalent to abstaining.

If at the end of the Voting Period:

* Less than or equal to half of the total outstanding eligible Roots votes in favor of the RIP, it fails; and
* More than half of the total outstanding eligible Roots votes in favor of the RIP, it passes.&#x20;

If at any time before the end of the Voting Period more than two-thirds of the total outstanding eligible Root votes in favor of the RIP, it passes and the RDM can commit and execute the RIP on-chain.

Root’s governance is modeled after Beanstalk’s governance. Root governance is designed to be as censorship resistant as possible. Any community member may submit RIPs. If a community member wishes to propose a RIP, they will need to complete a public proposal process on Discord and submit a Github pull request before the RDM will submit a Snapshot on their behalf.

RIPs are proposed on the [Root DAO Snapshot page](https://snapshot.org/#/rootsmoney.eth). Past RIPs can be read [here](https://github.com/RootToken/Root-Governance-Proposals/tree/main/rip).

### RSP

In its capacity as a Stalkholder, [0x77700005BEA4DE0A78b956517f099260C2CA9a26](https://etherscan.io/address/0x77700005BEA4DE0A78b956517f099260C2CA9a26) is entitled to vote on (1) each BIP and (2) other, non-BIP, governance processes, and may be entitled to non-Beanstalk-native yields.

Root Stalk Proposals (RSPs) are proposals for [0x77700005BEA4DE0A78b956517f099260C2CA9a26](https://etherscan.io/address/0x77700005BEA4DE0A78b956517f099260C2CA9a26) to determine how Root should use its Stalk in each governance process, and distribute yield, if ever.

Any BIP will automatically qualify to be proposed to Root DAO as an RSP. The RDM will repost BIPs on the [Root DAO Snapshot page](https://snapshot.org/#/rootsmoney.eth) as soon as possible after they are posted to the [Beanstalk DAO Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkdao.eth/) page. The RDM will vote on each BIP as determined by the RSP.

For other governance processes, any Root holder can propose a Root Stalk Proposal (RSP) on the [RSP Snapshot page](https://snapshot.org/#/rootstalkproposals.eth) to determine how Root should use its Stalk.

RSPs follow the same structure as RIPs, except that the length of the Voting Period can be reasonably shortened to ensure the will of Root DAO can be reflected in the governance process when appropriate.

RIPs are proposed on the [RSP Snapshot page](https://snapshot.org/#/rootstalkproposals.eth). Past RSPs can be read [here](https://github.com/RootToken/Root-Governance-Proposals/tree/main/rsp).
