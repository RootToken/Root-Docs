# Bug Bounty

The Root token contract is considered in-scope of the Beanstalk Immunefi Bug Bounty Program. The maximum bounty is 1,100,000 Beans.

You can find the bug bounty program and submit bug reports [here](https://immunefi.com/bounty/beanstalk).

In order to be considered for the maximum potential reward, bug reports must come with (1) a Proof of Concept (PoC), and (2) code implementing the fix.

Bug reports that do not come with a PoC and code implementing a fix may qualify for a maximum of up to 30% of the potential reward outlined below, as determined by the Beanstalk Immunefi Committee (BIC). You can read more about the BIC here:

* [BIC Process](https://docs.bean.money/almanac/governance/beanstalk/bic-process)
* [BIC Dashboard](https://docs.bean.money/almanac/governance/beanstalk/bic-dashboard)

All vulnerabilities noted in [any Halborn audit reports or the Trail of Bits audit report](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk-Audits) (or otherwise known by the BIC or [Beanstalk Community Multisig](https://docs.bean.money/almanac/governance/beanstalk/bcm-dashboard)) are not eligible for a reward.
